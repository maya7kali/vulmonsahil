VulmonSahil 



The VulmonSahil is a Python library created by Sahil Gaikwad that allows security researchers to easily retrieve detailed information about vulnerabilities from the Vulmon website (https://vulmon.com). It provides a simple interface for scraping data related to specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries.
Features

Retrieve meta information about a vulnerability, including CVE name, CVSSv3 score, published date, and description.
Gather information about vulnerable products associated with the vulnerability.
Extract exploit links related to the vulnerability.
Collect GitHub links associated with the vulnerability, handling relative paths and appending the appropriate base URL.
Retrieve reference links related to the vulnerability.

Installation

To use the VulmonScraper library, make sure you have Python installed. Then, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies (requests, BeautifulSoup, and lxml) by running the following command:

    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml

Download the vulmonscraper.py file from this repository and place it in your project directory.

Usage Example

python

# Import the necessary modules
    import vulmonsahil

# Create an instance of VulmonScraper with a specific CVE
    cve = "CVE-2023-25938"
    cveData = vulmonsahil.VulmonScraper(cve)

# Scrape the data for the CVE
    cveInfo = cveData.scrape_data()

# Access the scraped data
    print("CVE Name:", cveInfo["metaInfo"]["CVEName"])
    print("CVSSv3 Score:", cveInfo["metaInfo"]["CVSSv3"])
    print("Published Date:", cveInfo["metaInfo"]["PublishedDate"])
    print("Description:", cveInfo["metaInfo"]["Description"])
    print("Vulnerable Products:", cveInfo["vulnProducts"])
    print("Exploit Links:", cveInfo["exploitsLinks"])
    print("GitHub Links:", cveInfo["githubLinks"])
    print("Reference Links:", cveInfo["referenceLinks"])
